Introduction
A smart phone is a mobile phone built on a mobile operating system, with more advanced computing capability connectivity
than a feature phone. A lot of smart phones have an accelerometer used, for example, to change the camera orientation when
the smart phone is turn. That accelerometer actually measure how much activity is going on in, on three different axes.
This study was performed where that data was collected for a number of individuals and each individual participated in
several different types of activities. During those activities, they had the smart phone in their pocket, and the
accelerometer measured the types of activity that were going on.

Methods:
Data Collection
This analysis used a data sample from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which was prescribed by instructor Jeff Leek for
the Data Analysis class on Coursera.org. The data contained 7,352 observations, each containing 563 variables (including
the activity type and subject identifier). These data were downloaded from the course website on December 6, 2013 using
the R programming language. After collection, the data were partitioned along subject lines into training and test sets.
The training set contained subjects numbered 1, 3, 5, and 6; the test set contained subjects numbered 27,28, 29, and 30.
